    January 2019 - this page is in the process of getting updated.
    Some sections and tools are yet to be added and other ones are still missing details.
  </p>
<!--   <p>
    This collection of search tools contains the largest and most significant general-purpose resources for finding any information.
    The focus is on free, English-language, text content, however the most useful and largest non-free and non-English ones are included as well.

  </p>
  <p>
    If you are just using Google, you are missing out.
    Not all content is on Google, and event content that is on Google may not be easily found through it, nor does Google always present the best way of using it.

    Additionally, there is a tremendous amount of useful information that is not online...
  </p>

<section>
  <p>
    While <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
    is the most popular search engine, it is not the only one.
    There is no “best” search engine as it depends on what you are looking for.
    Every search engine has it’s own database of web pages (called an index), method of ranking pages (algorithm), and various features, and it is worth trying others out.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, Google includes results that do not exactly match your search terms, so you can select the “Google — verbatim” tool to find more exact matches.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> (by Microsoft)
    is the second most popular search engine.
    <a href="https://yandex.com/">Yandex</a> is very good as well, and is the most popular in Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>’s results come partly from Bing, but it does have it’s own index.
    Qwant is popular in France, where <a href="http://www.exalead.com/search/web/">Exalead</a> is also based.
  </p>
  <p>
    Amazingly,
    <a href="https://www.gigablast.com/">Gigablast</a> is run by a single person,
    and <a href="https://www.mojeek.com/">Mojeek</a> is run by a very small team in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://iseek.com/">iseek.ai</a> is a small search engine which allows you to narrow down your results by several attributes including topic groupings (similar to Yippy).
  </p>

  <h4>Advanced searching</h4>
  <p>
    You will have a much better time finding what you are looking for if you learn some of the special keywords and symbols that search engines use.
    The most common is to include <kbd>"quotation marks"</kbd> around a phrase, and all major search engines support this.
    Another common one is to put a minus symbol before a word to exclude it, such as <kbd>-excluded</kbd>.
    Learn more about these (known as search syntax and search operators) for each search engine:
    <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433">Google</a>
    (not all are listed on their own site, see
    <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/search-operators">a more complete list</a>),
    <a href="http://help.bing.microsoft.com/#apex/18/en/10002/-1">Bing</a> (and <a href="http://help.bing.microsoft.com/#apex/18/en/10001/-1">more Bing</a>),
    <a href="https://yandex.com/support/search/query-language/search-context.html">Yandex</a> (and <a href="https://yandex.com/support/search/query-language/search-operators.html">more Yandex</a>),
    <a href="https://help.qwant.com/help/qwant-search/searching/refine-search-with-operators/">Qwant</a>,
    <a href="https://www.exalead.com/search/web/search-syntax/">Exalead</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/syntax.html">Gigablast</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    These are tools which (mostly) do not have their own database of web pages to search.
    Instead, they use others’ while providing different features.
    All those listed here aside from Startpage display results at least in part from Bing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is the most popular of these alternative search engines.
    Features include <a href="https://duck.co/ia">instant answers</a> and
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">bangs</a>.
    See also <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/results/syntax/">DuckDuckGo search help</a>.
    Results are mostly from Bing, but depending on what you search for may come from other sites as well as their own index.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a> is the most popular cause-based search engine.
    A portion of their revenue is donated to help plant trees.
    Their results are from Bing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.etools.ch/">eTools.ch</a>
    is arguably the only real meta search engine included here.
    Meta search engines combine results from multiple other search engines,
    and were more common before Google dominated the industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://startpage.com/">Startpage</a>’s results come from Google, with the main difference being how they handle your privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://peekier.com/">Peekier</a>’s results come mainly from Bing.
    What really makes them different is the large previews of each web page.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://swisscows.ch/">Swisscows</a>’s
    results come from Bing, although they do have their own index if you use their German-language version.
    While most search engines have an option to filter adult content, Swisscows attempts to always exclude it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.yippy.com/">Yippy</a>’s results appear to come mostly from Bing,
    and their main feature are the topic groupings (similar to iseek.ai) that can help you narrow down the results.
  </p>

  <h4 id="privacy">Privacy and personalization</h4>
  <p>
    Many search engines now claim to make privacy a central feature.
    These search engines may also offer less personalization, which is when they use what they know about you to affect the ranking of results.
    These privacy-focused search engines includes Qwant, Mojeek, DuckDuckGo, eTools.ch, Startpage, Peekier, Swisscows, and Yippy.
    If privacy concerns you, read the policies of each search engine or read the <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/">reviews by Restore Privacy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the search engines listed above, another privacy-focused one is
    <a href="https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/">Searx</a>.
    Searx does not have a single website.
    Instead many people have set up their own copies of Searx, so you can visit the
    <a href="https://stats.searx.xyz/">list of Searx instances</a> to find one to use.
  </p>

  <h4>Filtered search engines</h4>
  <p>
    <a href="https://millionshort.com/">Million Short</a>, which shows results from Bing, has a few options to filter the results.
    They exclude the most popular websites, which helps to surface pages which you may not otherwise come across.
    Here, it is set to exclude the top 10,000 sites, although you can adjust this from the results page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Million Short also has an option to exclude e-commerce sites (here labelled “no buy”), which does not always work perfectly but may still be useful.
  </p>

    These search engines do not have an English version, but are useful when looking for information in other languages and regions.
    Some of the search tools listed in other sections are based in non-English-speaking countries, such as Qwant which is French.
  </p>
  <p>
    In China, Google is not available.
    <a href="http://www.baidu.com/" hreflang="zh-CN">Baidu</a> is the most popular search engine, followed by
    <a href="https://m.sm.cn/" hreflang="zh-CN">Shenma</a>,
    however Shenma is not available from their website.
    <a href="https://www.sogou.com/" hreflang="zh-CN">Sogou</a> and
    <a href="https://www.so.com/" hreflang="zh-CN">Haosou</a> are also used.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Russia,
    <a href="https://yandex.com/">Yandex</a> is the most popular search engine, followed by Google, with
    <a href="https://mail.ru/" hreflang="ru">Mail.ru</a> in third.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
    In Vietnam,
    <a href="https://coccoc.com/search" hreflang="vi" lang="vi">Cốc Cốc</a>
    is the second most popular search engine after Google.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Bangladesh, almost all searches are run on Google, however
    <a href="https://www.pipilika.com/" hreflang="bn">Pipilika</a>
    seems worth trying as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Czechia,
    <a href="https://www.seznam.cz/" hreflang="cs">Seznam</a>
    is the second most popular search engine after Google.

    <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram|Alpha</a>
    is an incredible tool that stands in a category of its own.

    News from about the year 2000 and more recent can be found on Newslookup.com and some of the other <a href="#news_search_engines">news search engines</a>.
    The tools in this section are free collections of mostly digitized newspapers.
    Digitization means that newspapers on paper or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microform">microform</a> (microfilm or microfiche) are scanned or photographed.
    The images are then converted to text using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">optical character recognition</a> (OCR),
    which is what enables searching by keyword.
    OCR is not perfect, especially for older newspapers.
    One useful strategy is to <a href="http://www.advantagearchives.com/preservation/preservation-resources/tip-change-the-letters-in-your-search/">take into account common OCR errors</a> when searching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every newspaper archive is a collection of various individual newspapers across various years.
    Any one newspaper may have some years available through several sites, other years available through a different site, and some years not yet digitized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many significant newspaper archives are only available from
    <a href="#paid_and_library_news_archives">paid and library services</a>
