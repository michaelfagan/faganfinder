<h3>Forums and mailing lists</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    These sites are various forms of online message boards, also called forums.
    Some of them are also mailing lists, meaning members can receive and send messages through email.

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/">LinkedIn</a> requires a (free) account in order to view search results.
    Even those that can be read by anyone require signing up in order to contribute,
    and some can only be joined with moderator approval.
    LinkedIn groups are often business-oriented, while the rest are general-purpose.

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> is a bit different than the others, in that in addition to posting text and links and commenting on those, users can also vote for or against each post.
    This means that the home page of each Subreddit (as they are called) shows what is popular at the moment.
