<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
  <p>YouTube may be the most popular website for videos, but there are a lot of videos that you won’t find there.</p>
  <p>You can use this page to run the same search across a wide range of sites for finding movies, television, and other videos as well as reviews, information, and more.</p>
  <p>
    This page emphasizes free resources, however some of the videos which can be found are restricted, i.e.
    they may require free registration,
    not be available in all regions,
    or require a fee or paid subscription.

<h3 id="engines">Search engines</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/videohp">Google</a>,
    <a href="http://www.bing.com/videos/trending">Bing</a>,
    <a href="https://yandex.com/video/">Yandex</a>,
    <a href="http://www.blinkx.com/">blinkx</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.mefeedia.com/">MeFeedia</a>
    are all search engines which can find videos from many different hosts, including <a href="#hosts">those on this page</a>.
    Most results are free to watch, but Bing and Google include some paid videos.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Social media</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    Use the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> searches above to find videos shared on those social sites.
    You must be logged into Facebook to get proper search results from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://vine.co/">Vine</a> was a social media site exclusively for sharing 6-second looping videos.

  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="hosts">Video hosts</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    Most websites do not host their own videos, but instead host them on

    <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/">DailyMotion</a>,
    <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>,

    <a href="http://www.veoh.com/">Veoh</a>,
    <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/">Metacafe</a>,
    and other popular video hosting sites.
    This is often cheaper, enables greater distribution, and includes useful features.   
  </p>
  <p>
    While the vides hosted on these sites are generally included in <a href="#engines">search engines</a>,
    some can be missed, and the host sites often have additional features not available from the search engines.
